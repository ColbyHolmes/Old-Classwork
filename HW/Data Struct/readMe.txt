Colby Holmes
Program 1
Due 9/21/16

All of the code is contained within the "prog1_holmes.cpp" file.
There is an included makefile, so just typing "make" into the console 
will compile the program and create an output file named "prog1".
That can be run from the console with "./prog1".

I included all of the required functions and added in a quit functionality
as well.

Not sure what is require from the "sample input and output" psrt of 
the assignment sheet. I hope the following is satisfactory:

**There is a menu in the program, I'd rather not type it out for all of
these samples.
{
[*prints menu*]
cmd>b

List empty: nothing to print...

[*prints menu*]
cmd>e

What value would you like to add: 5
[*prints menu*]
cmd>e

What value would you like to add: 8
[*prints menu*]
cmd>b


5 -> 8

[*prints menu*]
cmd>f

What value would you like to remove: 5
[*prints menu*]
cmd>d

What value would you like to test: 8
8 is in the list.

[*prints menu*]
cmd>q


Program closing...
