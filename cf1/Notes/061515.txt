----Maximal Independence Sets----
Using visual aids to create the most efficient set of items.
Ex. What is the shortest schedule for the college with this student schedules?
Anne - Computer Science, Econ
Bill - English, Math, Computer Science
Chris - Computer Science, Physics
We can group these sets by common factors.
English, Econ, and Physics can all be taken simulateously, without conflict.
Then, we choose either Computer Science or Math to go next.
That leaves only one class left to choose.

----Ways to Organize Data----
(Linked) Lists, Trees, Arrays, Stacks, Queues, *Structures, Maps, Heaps, Tables, and Graphs
Lists include Stacks and Queues
Trees are actually Heaps
Tables and Arrays are one and the same.

----Converting Bases----
5 -> Base 2 = 0000 0101
0000 1100 -> Base 10 = 12
23(Hex) -> Base 8 = (00 100 011) 43 -> Base 2 = 0010 0011 -> Base 10 = 35

----Lists----
Linked Lists are structures that hold data and a pointer to the next item in the list.
Lists can be two-way, and contain a pointer to the previous item.

----Dynamic Memory----
malloc() and free() in C, new and delete in C++
ALWAYS free memory after execution
