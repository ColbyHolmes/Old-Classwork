----Different Tree Forms----
Traversal, Prefix, Postfix, and Infix

		*
	      / \
	     +   c
	    / \
	   a   b

Traversal: (a+b)*c
Prefix: *+abc
Postfix: ab+c*
Infix: a+b*c

----Binary Tree----
Each node of a Binary tree has, at most, two children.
Expression trees are a form of binary trees.

		A
	      / \
	     B   D             Not a complete tree.
           / \	(Complete trees are full on every level)
          C   E
	      / \
	     F   G

Not a valid Binary Search Tree either.
This would be a correct binary search tree:
(Everything to the left of a node is less than everythng to the right)

		E
	      / \
	     B   G             
           / \	
          A   D
	      / \
	     C   F

Common commands:
is_leaf
left
right

Adding to the binary tree:
If root = null -> add Root
if = root do nothing
if x > root -> insert to the right
if x < root -> insert to the left
(for >, < set next node as "root" and repeat until final settling 
place reached.)

Deletion:
1) find x
2) if leaf, just delete node
3) if interior node, replace with either largest left element or 
smallest right element
