----Comparing Software----
Many problems arise from trying to compare computer software.
On the forefront of these issues is that not all systems are created equal.

One aspect to consider when comparing software is the general runtime of a program.

THE BIBLE for Algorithms:
0(1) - constant
0(log n) - logrithms
0(n) - linear
0(n log n) - n log n
0(n^2) - quadratic
0(n^3) - cubic
0(2^n) - exponential

----Big 0----
