----Sorting----
Permutations of a list to organize it into a generally sorted form
Iteration- repetition of a computation Ex. Loops 

Selection sort- checks all the items of the array and swaps the ideal with the 
first spot, then does the same for the second, then third, and so on.


----Recursion----
Recursive functions are functions to call upon themselves.
One of the main benefits is that the code is cleaner and smaller.
A major downside to it is that it is fragile code (can be broken easily).

----Induction----
Base cases- the original argument usually 0 or 1
Factorial =>> Base: 1!=1 Induction: n! = n x (n-1)!

----Merge Sort----
Used to sort smaller list then combine and sort the larger list

----Proof By Induction----
Statement S(n) with variable n
Prove the base case (usually 0 or 1)
Then prove it for n+1

5 steps:
1. Statement S(n) that you need to prove
2. The base case
3. The inductive hypothesis
4. A target to prove
5. The inductive step (show for all k and, by that, k+1)
